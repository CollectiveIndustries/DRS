# File Recovery and Diagnostics Suite

Diagnostic and Recovery Suite built ontop of Kali Linux and brought to you by Collective Industries.

FRDS, produced /fôrds/, will allow Data Recovery specialists to quickly optimize the input parameters to “GNU ddrescue,” maximizing the efficiency of time spent on other technical projects.  During the time that I did data recovery daily I identified key parts of the data recovery workflow and thought I might improve them as setting up a ddrescue recovery was time intensive when most of it was copping output from one program to another. FRDS will be targeted to working with ddrescue , rsync , chntpw , and smartctl .
