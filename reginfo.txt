Load the necessary registry hives:

    in Registry Editor (regedit), select either HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or HKEY_USERS, then click File → Load Hive, open the hive file, and input a temporary name for it;

    in command line, use reg load HKLM\temp-name path-to-hive
    or reg load HKU\temp‑name path-to-hive.

The hive files are located in:

    most of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE corresponds to files in %SystemRoot%\system32\config:
        HKLM\SAM – file SAM
        HKLM\SECURITY – file SECURITY
        HKLM\Software – file software
        HKLM\SYSTEM – file system
        the special "system" user's registry (e.g. login screen, etc.) – file default
    each user's personal registry (i.e. their HKEY_CURRENT_USER) is located in file NTUSER.DAT in their profile directory (e.g. C:\Users\grawity\NTUSER.DAT);
        however, HKCU\Software\Classes is stored in the file AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\UsrClass.dat.

A list of currently loaded hives is at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\hivelist.

what about HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT? Can't we load it?

I found that HKCR is actually classes key under software hive.

On Windows XP and later, it's a merged view of HKCU\Software\Classes and HKLM\Software\Classes.
The former is a separate hive, the latter isn't.

You don't mention HKEY_USERS that contains default values for all users. I read it corresponds to NTUSER.dat,
but not the one in the user directory. Is it correct?

Not quite. HKEY_USERS doesn't have any information by itself, all it has is sub-hives for each user.
For example, HKU\S-1-5-21-…-1103 corresponds to C:\Users\grawity\ntuser.dat,
and HKU\.default corresponds to C:\Windows\System32\config\DEFAULT.
(Note that .default is not the default user and does not contain "default values for all users". It's actually the "system" user.)
